The project opens a web server having different endpoints.

Copy and paste the folder and code in VS Code or any other IDE. 

Run - node index.js

Then type these endpoints in your default browser:

http://127.0.0.1:8000/overview

http://127.0.0.1:8000/product

http://127.0.0.1:8000/api

http://127.0.0.1:8000/apiNow

You'd see the endpoints and error message in action.
